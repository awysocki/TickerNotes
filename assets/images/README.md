# Icon Placeholder

Since this is a code-only environment, actual PNG icon files need to be created separately.

## Required Icon Sizes

Create icons in the following sizes and place them in `public/assets/images/`:

- icon-72x72.png (72x72)
- icon-96x96.png (96x96)
- icon-128x128.png (128x128)
- icon-144x144.png (144x144)
- icon-152x152.png (152x152)
- icon-192x192.png (192x192)
- icon-384x384.png (384x384)
- icon-512x512.png (512x512)

## Quick Icon Generation

You can use one of these tools to generate all icon sizes:

1. **Online Tools:**
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - https://favicon.io/
   - https://www.pwa-icon-generator.com/

2. **Manual Creation:**
   - Design your icon in 512x512 resolution
   - Export as PNG in all required sizes

## Temporary Solution

For testing, you can use a placeholder:
- Create a simple 512x512 colored square
- Save as icon-512x512.png
- Copy and resize for other sizes

The app will still work without icons, but they're recommended for a better PWA experience.
